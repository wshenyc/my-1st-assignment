        <h2>We're in a Housing Crisis</h2>
        <p>The economic crisis caused by COVID-19 has put nearly <a href="https://nlihc.org/sites/default/files/The_Eviction_Crisis_080720.pdf" target="_blank">
          40 million people</a> at risk of eviction.
          In an attempt to keep tenants housed, New York implemented a Rental Relief Program.
          However, the state only managed to distribute <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/ny-sitting-60-million-federal-rent-relief-weeks-spending-deadline" target="_blank">
          $40M of the $100M</a> available in federal aid.
          Not for lack of interest — <a href="https://hcr.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2020/10/covid-rrp-report.pdf" target="_blank">
            94,000 applications</a> were received — but 60% were denied
        due to the stringent eligibility requirements. </p>

        <p>Take this short quiz to find out if you would have been one of the lucky few to have qualified.</p>

        If you didn't fulfill all requirements, that means you unfortunately wouldn't have qualified.

        Did you know NYS has $1.3B in federal aid for rent relief laying around undistributed?
        If you think that's a problem, you should contact your state reps! For NYC residents,
        find out who that is <a href="https://www.mygovnyc.org/" target="_blank">here</a>!
